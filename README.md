# ðŸ‘‹ Hi there,
# ðŸŒŸ About Me
I am a PhD student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Carleton University in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. My research focuses on designing AI-based optimized and secure home energy systems, peer-to-peer energy trading systems, and micro-grids. I use Machine Learning techniques, especially reinforcement learning, Deep Learning, Graph Attention Networks, LangGraph, LangChain, etc., for AI-Reasoning, Multi-Variate Time Series Analysis, and Automation.

## ðŸŽ“ Background
I hold an MSc and a BSc from Tabriz University of Technology, both in Electrical Engineering with a specialty in Control System Design. I designed control systems using data-driven methods such as Virtual Reference Feedback Tuning (VRFT), convex optimization, Fuzzy Inference Systems (FIS), and evolutionary algorithms to achieve stability and robustness.
