# 👋 Hi there,
# About Me 🌟
I am a PhD student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Carleton University in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. My research focuses on designing AI-empowered optimized and secure home energy systems, peer-to-peer energy trading systems, and micro-grids. I use Machine Learning techniques, especially reinforcement learning, Deep Learning, Graph Attention Networks, LangGraph, LangChain, etc., for AI-Reasoning, Multi-Variate Time Series Analysis, and Automation.

## Background 🎓
I hold an MSc and a BSc from Tabriz University of Technology, both in Electrical Engineering with a specialty in Control System Design. I designed control systems using data-driven methods such as Virtual Reference Feedback Tuning (VRFT), convex optimization, Fuzzy Inference Systems (FIS), and evolutionary algorithms to achieve stability and robustness. 

## Research Interest 🔬

- Cybersecurity and Anomaly Detection
- Agentic AI and Knowledge Distillation for Intelligent Control Systems Design
- Machine Learning and Deep Reinforcement Learning
- Multi-Variate Time Series Forecasting and Analysis

## Let's connect! 📩

Always happy to talk about research, open-source projects, or new ideas!
