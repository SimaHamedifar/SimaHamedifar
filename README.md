### ðŸ‘‹ Hi there,
### About Me
I am a PhD student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Carleton University in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. My research focuses on designing AI-based optimized and secure home energy systems, peer-to-peer energy trading systems, and micro-grids. I use Machine Learning techniques, especially reinforcement learning, Deep Learning, Graph Attention Networks, LangGraph, LangChain, etc., for AI-Reasoning, Multi-Variate Time Series Analysis, and Automation.
